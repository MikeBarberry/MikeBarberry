Hi! I'm a full stack engineer currently working with CSI on a number of custom websites for multiple clients. 

They're private so you won't see them here. But I do have three public repositories. Two are from when I was first starting out and one is a full stack MERN site. It's hosted on [heroku](http://my-api-heroku-1.herokuapp.com)

You can find more of my code here [on my Flatiron School account](https://github.com/MikeBarberry-Flatiron)

My personal website is coming soon!
